# Iris Flower Classification using KNN

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The four features measured are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/iris-flower-classification.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages. You can use pip for this:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure you have the dataset file "iris.data.csv" in the project directory.

## Usage

Once you have installed the required dependencies and have the dataset file, you can run the Jupyter notebook `iris_flower_classification.ipynb` to see the code implementation and analysis. This notebook includes steps for data exploration, visualization, model training, and prediction.

## Results

The KNN classifier achieved a prediction accuracy of [insert accuracy here] on the test set. The model was able to accurately classify new iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Future Work

Some potential improvements and future work for this project include:

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters of the KNN classifier for better performance.
- Exploring other machine learning algorithms and comparing their performance.
- Deploying the trained model as a web application or API for easy access.
